### **Setting Up the Knowledge Base (S3 Integration)**

Set up the Knowledge Base using **S3 Integration**. You may also use a **cross-account S3 bucket**.

After selecting the AWS Account and S3 Bucket, **Quick Suite automatically generates the required S3 bucket policy**.
Copy and paste this policy into the bucket's permissions to complete the integration.
